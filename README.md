# Wine Quality Analysis

## Overview...
This project analyzes how chemical properties influence wine quality, using the well‑known Wine Quality dataset. I led a team of four to explore the relationships between physicochemical attributes and quality ratings, applying statistical analysis and machine‑learning models to identify the strongest predictors of wine quality.

The goal of the project was to support a data‑driven wine‑evaluation guide, helping consumers and producers understand which chemical features most strongly impact perceived quality.


## Objective...
- Identify which chemical properties most strongly correlate with wine quality
- Build predictive models to classify wine quality based on chemical features
- Evaluate model performance and interpret feature importance
- Produce clear documentation and a reproducible workflow


## Methodology...
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed missing or inconsistent values
- Normalized and scaled features where appropriate
- Split data into training and testing sets

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions and correlations
- Identified key chemical properties linked to higher quality ratings
- Compared red vs. white wine characteristics

3. Modeling
- Implemented and evaluated:
- K‑Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

**Models were assessed using:**

- Accuracy
- Confusion matrices
- Cross‑validation

4. Interpretation
- Ranked feature importance
- Highlighted chemical drivers of high‑quality wines
- Summarized actionable insights for wine evaluation


## Key Findings...
- Alcohol content, volatile acidity, and sulphates were among the strongest predictors of quality
- SVM outperformed KNN in classification accuracy
- Certain chemical thresholds consistently aligned with higher quality ratings
